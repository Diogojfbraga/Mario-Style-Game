# Game Project - Introduction to Programming I (2020/2021)
**Student Number - 200409407**

## Overview
Welcome to my Game Project developed as part of the Introduction to Programming I course. This project showcases my journey in learning programming fundamentals through the creation of an interactive game.

## Game Features
### Graphics
- Implemented a special belly rotation effect for the game character.
- Utilized constructor functions for generating random background elements (clouds, trees, flowers) and fixed locations for canyons and mountains.
- Day-to-night background transition with the sun and moon changing positions.

### Sound
- Integrated various sounds for different in-game events:
  - Background sounds with adjustable volume playing continuously.
  - Jumping sound when the space key is pressed.
  - Falling sound when the character descends into a canyon.
  - Enemy contact sound when the character touches an enemy.
  - Collecting sound for diamonds with volume control.
  - Game completion sound when reaching the flagpole.

## Game Elements
- **Game Variables:** Manage the game character's position, movement, and other crucial parameters.
- **Objects:** Mountains, collectables, canyons, flagpole, clouds, trees, flowers, and enemies.
- **Score System:** Keep track of the player's score throughout the game.
- **Lives Mechanism:** Three lives are provided, and the player loses a life when falling off the screen or touching an enemy.

## Challenges and Learnings
- Overcame challenges in implementing the constructor function for random background elements.
- Faced difficulties in controlling the character's jump behavior but successfully resolved the issue.
- Enjoyed the learning process, especially in adding sounds to enhance the gaming experience.

## How to Play
1. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the character.
2. Press the spacebar to make the character jump.
3. Collect diamonds for points and avoid enemies.
4. Reach the flagpole to complete the level.

## Acknowledgments
- Background sounds and sound effects were obtained from freesound.org (see references).
- Special thanks to guided instructions for beginners, contributing to this rewarding end result.

## Instructions for Running the Game
1. Download the code and sound files.
2. Set up a local environment with the necessary tools for running JavaScript games.
3. Open the HTML file in a web browser to play the game.
4. Feel free to explore and enjoy the game!
